<p>Let's get started with how does a website is built? Most of the websites are run by only three languages(HTML, CSS & JavaScript). It can be said that these three are building blocks of any website. Okay, let's see practically, just open any website of your choice, and right click on a page you will find an inspect option, click it. Once it is clicked you will find some piece of code is open in an inspector window.Mostly all the websites rely on these three languages. At the time of developing it can be written in any languages, but when it comes to the browser you will find these three languages.Now let's see the role of these languages one by one and how they are being used to build a website. We will see how they are related to each other and what's the difference between them.
