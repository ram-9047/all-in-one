					CSS should be used to add content to a web page. That task is best handled by markup languages such as HTML and XML. Instead, CSS is used to pick items that already exist on a web page and to define how each item should appear.In order to make it as easy as possible to select items on a web page, identifiers should be added to elements on the webpage. These identifiers, often called hooks in the context of CSS, make it easier to identify the items that should be affected by the CSS rules.Classes and IDs are used as hooks for CSS styles. While the way CSS renders is not affected by the use of classes and hooks, they give developers the ability to pinpoint HTML elements that they wish to style.
