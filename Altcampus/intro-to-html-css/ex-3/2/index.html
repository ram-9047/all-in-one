					Grid layouts have been the go-to strategy for designing responsive layouts for several years. CSS grids have been created from scratch for years and there are many different grid-generating websites and development frameworks on the market. However, within a few years, support for grid layouts will be part of the CSS3 specification. You can learn a lot about grids by reading up on the topic at the W3C website. For a lighter and shorter introduction to grid layouts, take a look at this article from Mozilla.Within a few years, CSS3 Flexible Box, or flexbox, is expected to become the dominant model for designing website layouts. The flexbox specification is not yet entirely complete and finalized, and support for flexbox is not consistent between browsers.

The Mozilla Developer Network is one of the best places to get up to speed on flexbox.
